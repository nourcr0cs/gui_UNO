# GUI for UNO Game

Elements suposed to be in the Framework are mixed up in the view and default packages with the GUI and needs further organization.

The Frames except the Main frame ("SupposedMain") needs to be reprogrammed as Panels later on.

Run each java file with "Main" in its name for Game actual principle Panels (four in total, and supposed to be when View and Controller are finally well set up).

Actual Controller contains the link with the main Game match only (Check Demo video for better illustrating).
